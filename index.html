        <h2 class="charact-title">Some characteristics about Rose Quartz</h2>
        <div class="info-container">
            <p class="about-text">Translucent, usually turbid, very coarse-grained variety of the silica mineral quartz
                found in pegmatites. Rose quartz is valued for its pale- to rich-pink colour, which may be due to
                titanium. It has been carved since early times and has been faceted to provide gems of good
                brilliance. Its milky aspect is attributed to tiny needlelike inclusions of rutile, which, when
                oriented, give the polished stone an asterism (optical phenomenon of a star-shaped figure) like that
                found in sapphire, but not as sharp or intense. Rose quartz occurs in Brazil, Sweden, Namibia,
                California, and Maine. Its properties are those of quartz.</p>

            <p class="about-text">The use of rose quartz is said to date back as far as 7,000 B.C. It’s also been
                claimed that Egyptian and Roman women used rose quartz face masks to clear their complexions and prevent
                wrinkles. Today rose quartz is often used as jewelry, for meditation, or as decoration in homes or
                office spaces.</p>

        <h2 class="charact-title">& its magical properties</h2>
        <div class="info-container">
            <p class="about-text">“Rose quartz is a powerful healing crystal,” says crystal healer and reiki master
                Keith Birch, owner of KSC Crystals. “Its soft, gentle, almost pastel pale pink coloring is a good
                indication of its most commonly known property: that of pure love. It’s a stone of both giving and
                receiving love.”

                As Birch says, rose quartz is believed by many to encourage the qualities of love.

                However, it’s important to note that there’s a lack of research to support these claims about crystals.
                In fact, there’s very little evidence to support the benefits of crystals at all.</p>

                <p class="quote-text">“Predominantly, rose quartz is a crystal of unconditional love that brings deep
                    healing to the heart
                    by opening the heart chakra,” Birch explains. “Once achieved, a deeper state of calmness, serenity,
                    and peace is reached, which ultimately results in complete relaxation, encouraging the feelings of
                    happiness and contentment.”</p>
